# Custom Framework Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to transform the React Router app into a custom framework implementation.

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/routes.js`
**Before**: Used React Router dev helpers (`index`, `layout`, `route`)
```javascript
import { index, layout, route } from "@react-router/dev/routes";

export default [
    layout("layouts/AppLayout.jsx", [
        index("pages/home.jsx"),
        route("about","pages/about/About.jsx")
    ])
];
```

**After**: Custom route configuration with direct component imports
```javascript
import App from "./root.jsx";
import AppLayout from "./layouts/AppLayout.jsx";
import Home from "./pages/home.jsx";
import About from "./pages/about/About.jsx";

export default [
  {
    path: "/",
    Component: App,
    children: [
      {
        path: "/",
        Component: AppLayout,
        children: [
          {
            index: true,
            Component: Home,
            loader: async ({ context }) => {
              const { db } = context;
              const posts = await db.Post.findMany();
              return { posts };
            },
          },
          {
            path: "about",
            Component: About,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

### 2. `app/pages/home.jsx`
**Changed**: Removed loader function (now defined in routes.js)
- Loader moved to central route configuration
- Component simplified to only handle rendering

### 3. `app/root.jsx`
**Changed**: Simplified for custom framework
- Removed React Router specific exports (`links`, HTML structure)
- Simplified to core App component and error boundary
- Layout component now just wraps children

### 4. `server/app.js`
**Before**: Used `createRequestHandler` from React Router Express
```javascript
import { createRequestHandler } from "@react-router/express";

app.use(
  createRequestHandler({
    build: () => import("virtual:react-router/server-build"),
    getLoadContext: async(req, res) => {
      // ...
    }
  })
);
```

**After**: Custom request handler with direct React Router integration
```javascript
import { render } from "../app/entry.server.jsx";

app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const context = await getKeystoneContext(req, res);
    const request = new Request(`${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}${req.originalUrl}`, {
      method: req.method,
      headers: new Headers(req.headers),
    });

    const response = await render(request, { ...context, req, res });
    // Handle response...
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
});
```

### 5. `vite.config.js`
**Changed**: Removed React Router plugin, added custom build configuration
- Removed `reactRouter()` plugin
- Added custom build inputs for client and server
- Added SSR configuration

### 6. `package.json`
**Changed**: Updated scripts to use custom build system
- `build`: Now uses custom build script
- Removed React Router specific commands
- Simplified development and production scripts

## New Files Created

### 1. `app/entry.client.jsx`
**Purpose**: Client-side entry point for browser rendering
- Creates `createBrowserRouter` with route configuration
- Handles hydration with server data
- Manages client-side loaders (would make API calls)

### 2. `app/entry.server.jsx`
**Purpose**: Server-side entry point for SSR
- Uses `createStaticHandler` for server rendering
- Injects Keystone context into loaders
- Generates complete HTML with hydration data
- Manages response headers

### 3. `scripts/build.js`
**Purpose**: Custom build script for production
- Builds separate client and server bundles
- Uses Vite programmatically
- Replaces React Router's build system

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Data Loading
- **Server**: Loaders execute with full Keystone context
- **Client**: Loaders simplified (would make API calls in real app)
- **Hydration**: Data passed via `window.__staticRouterHydrationData`

### Request Handling
- Express requests converted to Web API Request objects
- Custom rendering pipeline with Keystone integration
- Manual response handling and header management

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Vite middleware with HMR
- **Production**: Pre-built static assets and server bundle
- **Unified**: Same custom framework for both environments

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Full Control**: Complete control over build and rendering pipeline
2. **Custom Integration**: Seamless Keystone integration without middleware
3. **Flexibility**: Can be adapted to any backend or hosting environment
4. **Performance**: Optimized for specific use case without framework overhead
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and explicit dependencies

## Framework Features Maintained

- ✅ Server-side rendering (SSR)
- ✅ Data loading with loaders
- ✅ Client-side hydration
- ✅ Nested routing
- ✅ Error boundaries
- ✅ Hot module replacement (development)
- ✅ Static asset optimization (production)

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a custom React Router framework that can be extended with additional features as needed while maintaining full control over the rendering and data loading pipeline.
